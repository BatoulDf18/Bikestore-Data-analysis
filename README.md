Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of bikestore data to identify key business insights. By leveraging SQL Server for data querying, Excel for data manipulation and pivot tables, and Tableau for interactive visualizations, we aim to present actionable information for business decisions.
Technologies Used

    Microsoft Excel: For processing data and creating pivot tables and dashboards.
    SQL Server: For querying and extracting data.
    Tableau: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

Data Collection

The dataset used in this project comes from the bikestore database. It includes information on sales, customers, products, and more. The data was extracted from SQL Server using a custom query.
Data Processing
SQL Server

The initial data extraction was performed using the following query:

sql

[Include your SQL query here]

This query pulls relevant data from the bikestore database to be used in further analysis.
Excel

The extracted data was then imported into Excel for processing. Key steps included:

    Creating pivot tables to summarize and analyze the data.
    Developing dashboards to visualize the data insights.

Data Analysis

In Excel, the following analyses were performed:

    Sales analysis by product category, region, and time period.
    Customer segmentation based on purchase history and demographics.
    Inventory management insights through analysis of stock levels and turnover rates.

Visualization

Tableau was used to create interactive visualizations to enhance data insights. Key visualizations include:

    Sales trends over time.
    Customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
    Product performance and inventory levels.

Results and Findings

The analysis revealed several key insights:

    [Highlight significant findings, such as top-performing products, sales trends, customer segments, etc.]
    [Discuss any patterns or correlations discovered in the data.]

Future Work

Future analysis could include:

    Further segmentation of customers for targeted marketing.
    Predictive modeling to forecast sales trends.
    Optimization of inventory management based on sales patterns.
