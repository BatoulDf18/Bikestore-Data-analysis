## Project Overview

This project analyzes BikeStore data to [briefly state your main objectives, e.g., "understand sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management"]. By leveraging SQL Server for data extraction, Excel for pivot table analysis, and Tableau for advanced visualizations, we aim to provide comprehensive insights into the BikeStore's operations.

## Tools Used

- SQL Server: For initial data querying and extraction
- Microsoft Excel: For pivot table analysis and dashboard creation
- Tableau: For creating advanced visualizations and interactive dashboards

## Data Source

The data used in this project comes from [describe your data source, e.g., "a BikeStore database containing sales, inventory, and customer information from 2018 to 2022"].

## Analysis Process

1. **SQL Server Query**: 
   - Wrote and executed a complex query to extract relevant data from the BikeStore database.
   - [Briefly describe what your query does, e.g., "The query joins multiple tables to compile sales data, customer information, and product details."]

2. **Excel Analysis**:
   - Imported the SQL query results into Excel.
   - Created pivot tables to analyze [mention what you analyzed, e.g., "sales by region, product category performance, seasonal trends"].
   - Developed a dashboard in Excel to visualize key metrics.

3. **Tableau Visualization**:
   - Connected Tableau to the Excel file containing the analyzed data.
   - Created interactive visualizations and dashboards to represent [mention what you visualized, e.g., "sales trends, customer segmentation, and inventory turnover"].

## Results and Visualizations

[Briefly describe your key findings and insights. You can add screenshots of your Excel dashboard and Tableau visualizations here if you're hosting them on GitHub. Otherwise, provide instructions on where to find the visuals in your repository.]

## Files in this Repository

- `BikeStore_Analysis_Query.sql`: The SQL query used to extract data from SQL Server.
- `BikeStore_Analysis.xlsx`: Excel file containing pivot tables and dashboard.
- `BikeStore_Visualizations.twb`: Tableau workbook with visualizations and dashboards.
- [List any other relevant files in your repository]

## How to Use This Project

1. Execute the SQL query in `BikeStore_Analysis_Query.sql` on your SQL Server instance containing the BikeStore database.
2. Open `BikeStore_Analysis.xlsx` to view the Excel pivot tables and dashboard. Refresh the data connection if needed.
3. Open `BikeStore_Visualizations.twb` in Tableau to interact with the visualizations. You may need to reconnect to the Excel data source.
